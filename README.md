# Reinforcement Learning for Economics
This repository hosts a jupyter notebook that introduces **Reinforcement Learning** in a basic and gradual manner. It is aimed towards an audience that is assumed not to be familiar with any concept of reinforcement learning.

This work is the result of the final project of the [Econophysics course](https://terna.to.it/) of the University of Turin, held by prof. Terna.
